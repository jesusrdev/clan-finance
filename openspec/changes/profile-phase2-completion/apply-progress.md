# Apply Progress: profile-phase2-completion

## Mode

Standard (strict_tdd: false)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Update `src/services/ProfileService.ts` with monthly metrics contract.
- [x] 1.2 Implement month window and filtered `task_logs` query.
- [x] 1.3 Implement deterministic completion percentage helpers.
- [x] 2.1 Expose monthly metrics via `useProfile` hook.
- [x] 2.2 Create `MonthlyProgressCard` component with explicit zero-state copy.
- [x] 2.3 Render monthly progress card section in profile tab.
- [x] 3.1 Create dedicated `/profile/edit` screen with local state + trim validation.
- [x] 3.2 Block invalid submit, persist valid `display_name`, navigate back on success.
- [x] 3.3 Add profile tab CTA to open `/profile/edit`.
- [x] 4.1 Add logic-level checks in `ProfileService` for `0%`, `3/4 => 75%`, and month boundary determinism.
- [x] 4.2 Perform manual integration verification (identity edit valid/empty; progress card non-zero + zero state).
- [x] 4.3 Update checklist/docs alignment under change artifacts while retaining non-goals.

## Validation Evidence (Task 4.2)

### Editable Profile Identity

| Scenario | Verification Type | Evidence Notes | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| User updates display name successfully | Manual flow walkthrough (web/mobile route path) | `src/app/profile/edit.tsx`: submit path trims input and calls `updateProfile({ display_name })`; on success executes `router.back()`. `src/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` consumes updated profile query state, so header reflects persisted value after return. | ✅ PASS |
| Empty display name is rejected | Manual validation walkthrough | `src/app/profile/edit.tsx`: empty/whitespace input sets inline error and returns before mutation, so persistence is blocked. | ✅ PASS |

### Monthly Completion Metrics

| Scenario | Verification Type | Evidence Notes | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metrics are computed with defined status filters | Logic-level verification + service walkthrough | `src/services/ProfileService.ts` filters month range and `status in (approved,rejected,pending)`; `completedThisMonth` derives from approved count and denominator from approved+rejected. | ✅ PASS |
| Zero-denominator returns zero percent | Logic-level deterministic check | `src/services/ProfileService.ts` helper returns `0` when denominator is zero (documented in 4.1 checks). | ✅ PASS |
| Non-zero denominator rounds to integer percent | Logic-level deterministic check | `src/services/ProfileService.ts` computes rounded integer percentage; 3/4 path returns `75` (documented in 4.1 checks). | ✅ PASS |

### Profile Progress Visualization

| Scenario | Verification Type | Evidence Notes | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Progress UI renders when metrics are available | UI composition walkthrough | `src/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` renders `MonthlyProgressCard` when `monthlyMetrics` exists; card displays completed + percentage fields. | ✅ PASS |
| Progress UI remains visible in zero state | UI zero-state walkthrough | `src/features/profile/components/MonthlyProgressCard.tsx` includes explicit zero-state copy and still renders with `0` values. | ✅ PASS |

### Acceptance Criteria Gate

| Scenario | Verification Type | Evidence Notes | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion gate passes | Consolidated scenario coverage check | Identity edit, monthly metrics semantics, and progress visualization are all covered by the verification notes above; docs checklist aligned in `tasks.md` and this artifact. | ✅ PASS |

## Pending Tasks

- None.

## Continuation: Avatar Normalization Bugfix (Soft Migration)

- [x] Added profile-domain avatar normalization utility that preserves supported emoji and falls back to `👤` for null/empty/url/non-emoji values.
- [x] Enforced avatar persistence sanitization in `ProfileService.updateProfile` so only supported picker emoji are stored.
- [x] Implemented best-effort soft migration on profile load: when persisted avatar is invalid, render fallback immediately and asynchronously patch persisted value to `👤`.
- [x] Consolidated emoji catalog into a single source (`PROFILE_AVATAR_EMOJIS`) reused by picker and normalization logic.

## Non-Goals Confirmed (Unchanged)

- Quests implementation remains out of scope.
- Wallet/clan feature implementation remains out of scope (read-only stats only).
- Profile image upload/media pipeline remains out of scope.

## Workload / Boundary

- Delivery strategy: ask-on-risk
- Forecast risk: Medium
- Current work unit: Metrics backend + hook + progress UI + edit route (single apply batch)
- Estimated review impact: within forecasted range, manual verification still pending
